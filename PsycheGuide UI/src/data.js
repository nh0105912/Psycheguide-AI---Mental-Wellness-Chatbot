Anxiety is a natural emotional response to stress — but when it becomes overwhelming, it can affect daily life.
Learning to understand your triggers and recognizing early signs can help reduce anxiety before it takes control.

Identifying Triggers:
Notice patterns — does anxiety arise before social events, exams, travel, or unexpected changes?
Recognizing these helps you prepare and respond with awareness.

Grounding Yourself:
When anxiety peaks, return to your senses: 
• Name 5 things you can see
• 4 you can touch
• 3 you can hear
• 2 you can smell
• 1 you can taste
This shifts your focus back to the present moment.

Building Healthy Coping Practices:
Daily habits such as journaling, mindful breaks, and regular exercise lower baseline anxiety levels.
Small steps matter — consistency is more important than intensity.

Remember:
Anxiety does not define you. It's a part of your experience, not your identity.
Learning to work *with* your emotions builds resilience and inner strength.

When panic rises, your breath becomes fast and shallow — signaling danger to your body.
By slowing your breath, you tell your nervous system that you are safe.

Box Breathing (4-4-4-4):
• Inhale for 4 seconds
• Hold for 4
• Exhale for 4
• Hold for 4
Repeat 4 rounds. Notice the slowing of your heartbeat.

Extended Exhale:
• Inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 6
This activates the parasympathetic nervous system — your body's calming system.

Affirmation While Breathing:
"I am safe in this moment."
"These feelings will pass."
"I can breathe through this."

With practice, breathing becomes your inner anchor during emotional storms.

Mindful breathing is the foundation of present-moment awareness.
It pulls your attention away from worries of the past and fears of the future.

Try This:
Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly.
Breathe slowly — feel your belly rise before your chest.
Notice warmth, movement, and rhythm without judgment.

If the mind wanders — that's okay.
Gently bring it back to your breath, again and again.
The return is the practice.

Mindful breathing creates space between stimulus and reaction — 
allowing you to respond rather than react.

Focus weakens when the mind jumps rapidly between thoughts.
Mindfulness sharpens focus by training your attention like a muscle.

One-Minute Mind Reset:
• Sit still
• Breathe slowly
• Count breaths from 1–10
• If your mind wanders, restart gently
This resets attention and improves clarity.

Mindful Transitions:
Before switching tasks, pause for 10 seconds.
Acknowledge what you're leaving, breathe, and set an intention for what's next.
This prevents mental overload and reduces stress.

Remember:
Clarity doesn't come from rushing — it comes from *pausing*.

Depression doesn't always appear as constant sadness.
Sometimes it's quiet: loss of interest, exhaustion, numbness, or withdrawal.

Early Signs:
• Losing motivation for things you once enjoyed
• Feeling heavy or tired without clear reason
• Sleeping too much or too little
• Thoughts that feel foggy or slow

Reaching out is a strength.
Support from friends, family, or professionals can open the first door to recovery.
